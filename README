In this module we implement multiple leetcode problems

# Working in Python directory 

Simply navigate to /Python and run any of the functions: 
> python3 1_twosum.py
The test is implicit in the function file. 

You can also run all tests at once with:
> python3 testall.py

# Working in C directory

run:
> compile.sh
to compile all functions and run tests

# Working in Cpp directory

run: 
> bazel test --cxxopt=-std=c++14 --test_output=all //...
To compile and run all of the tests.
